<p>This is a lightweight and easy to use library to create and add ID3 metadata
tags to MP3-files. It only concerns itself with ID3 version 3.2.0 and only the
most common frame types. On the other hand, the most common use case of simply
adding some metadata fields to an MP3 file is really simple.</p>

<p>A higher level interface is available in the class {@link com.voxbiblia.id3j.ID3Tool} with the
lower level interface in {@link com.voxbiblia.id3j.ID3Serializer}</p>
